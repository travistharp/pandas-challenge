        <p>The data dive continues!
            Now, it's time to take what you've learned about Python Pandas
            and apply it to new situations. For this assignment, you'll need
            to complete one of two (not both)  Data Challenges. Once again,
            which challenge you take on is your choice. Just be sure to give
            it your all -- as the skills you hone will become powerful
            tools in your data analytics tool belt.</p>
